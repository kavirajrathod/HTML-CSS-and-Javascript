After JNU students alleged that they sent SOS alerts to Delhi Police seeking immediate help on Sunday afternoon when armed goons entered the campus, the police have said that five personnel were present near the administration block but they didn't have authorisation to act.

In a clarification following the charges of inaction, Delhi Police has now said that five police personnel were stationed near admin block as per Delhi High Court orders, which said no protest or demonstration can happen around 100 meters of the JNU admin block.
